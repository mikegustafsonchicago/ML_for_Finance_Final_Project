        <h2>Wind Pattern Analysis: KORD Airport</h2>
        
        <div class="model-description">
            <h3>Analysis Overview</h3>
            <p>This analysis examines wind patterns at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (KORD) during the first week of April 2020. 
            The visualization shows wind speed and direction patterns throughout the day, categorized into four time periods:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Night:</strong> 00:00-06:00 (Purple)</li>
                <li><strong>Morning:</strong> 06:00-12:00 (Orange)</li>
                <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> 12:00-18:00 (Green)</li>
                <li><strong>Evening:</strong> 18:00-24:00 (Blue)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Visualization Details</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radial Distance:</strong> Represents wind speed in meters per second (m/s)</li>
                <li><strong>Angle (Wind Direction):</strong> Represents the direction the wind is coming from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0째 (North): Wind coming from the north</li>
                        <li>90째 (East): Wind coming from the east</li>
                        <li>180째 (South): Wind coming from the south</li>
                        <li>270째 (West): Wind coming from the west</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Indicates time of day, helping to identify daily wind patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Interpretation Guide</h4>
            <p>When reading these radar plots:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Points further from the center indicate stronger winds</li>
                <li>The angle shows where the wind is coming from (not where it's going)</li>
                <li>Clusters of points in similar directions suggest prevailing wind patterns</li>
                <li>Different colors in the same direction indicate how wind patterns change throughout the day</li>
            </ul>
